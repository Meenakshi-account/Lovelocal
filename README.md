Easy 1
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
This program first removes spaces, then checks if the string is empty. If the string is empty, it means sentence is not provided. If there is  only one word, it returns the length of the word as output. Otherwise, it finds the last space, the length of the word after it is calculated. Prints the last word and length.
